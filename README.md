## _Only See Tweets that Agree With You_
Browsing Twitter can be difficult, because people criticize the things you like. So, only look at positive tweets!

For our Deep Learning 1 class, we built a model to classify whether the sentiment of a tweet is positive or negative, filter out the negative tweets, change their sentiment to positive, and then present only positive tweets.

## Setup Instructions
- Clone the repository
- In the root folder, rename "connection_info_example.csv" to "connection_info.csv"
- Fill your Twitter API credentials into connection_info.csv
- Download the [Twitter Sentiment Analysis Training Corpus](http://thinknook.com/twitter-sentiment-analysis-training-corpus-dataset-2012-09-22/) - click the link that reads "Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset"
- In get_positive_tweets.ipynb, fill in your own systems FILE_PATH and the query you want to search Twitter for into "query"
- Run get_positive_tweets.ipynb
